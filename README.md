## Known issues

An image is slightly flickering, due to implementation details. An image should be tripple-layered to get rid of this effect.

## Build and run
This piece of software must be built with [Keil MKD5](http://www2.keil.com/mdk5/) and run on [STM32F7-discovery](http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f746gdiscovery.html)

No additional equipment is required.
